# Random

This is a random repository which I look at from time to time and test in.
All pre-release material is for previous years that is public - I would not recommend copying my code, only look at it as a reference.

Anything found inside of this repository is free to use without needing to for credit.

However if you do wish to credit, please use: https://github.com/bradpowles
