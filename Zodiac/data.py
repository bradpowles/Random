        'end_range' : [29, 4],
        'fact' : "You can always count on an Aries to take charge of any situation. Their willingness to take initiative carries over in romantic situations too. They hate dating people with low energy or anyone who makes them feel like they're keeping them from reaching their full potential. If you're a non-Aries dating an Aries, you better be up to the challenge of keeping them entertained and interested, or you may lose them."

        'start_range' : [23, 7],
        'end_range' : [22, 8],
        'fact' : "Leos are often dismissed as self-centered, but they're also one of the most loyal and devoted signs in the zodiac. You'll rarely meet a Leo unwilling to help their friends out, even if it makes them look bad or isn't the wisest financial move. But would you really expect anything less than that for the sign that's represented by the lion and ruled by the sun?"

        'fact' : "While mostly known for their humor and wit, Sagittarians are also one of the most sensitive signs in the zodiac. They love deep discussions, and are some of the most genuine listeners and conversationalists you'll ever meet."

        'end_range' : [20, 5],
        'fact' : "As an Earth sign, Taurus is one of the more reliable and stable signs in the zodiac. They're super grounded and usually into things for the long haul. This makes them really good at long-distance relationships especially, as it takes way more than distance to shake their confidence and sense of security."

        'start_range' : [23, 8],
        'end_range' : [22, 9],
        'fact' : "Detail-oriented and organized, a Virgo's intensity for work and life can be intimidating to others at first. If you're a Virgo, remember to take a step back and relax every so often. Sometimes the outcome will be the same regardless of if you put 10 seconds or 10 hours into a task."

        'end_range' : [19, 1],
        'fact' : "While Capricorns may seem all wise and responsible on the outside, they're often secretly fighting back tons of insecurity on the inside. While people in their lives might not be able to sense it (which is the goal of every cool, calm, and collected Capricorn,) it's never a bad idea to check in with people every once in a while and open up."

        'start_range' : [21, 5],
        'end_range' : [20, 6],
        'fact' : "While a Gemini may get a bad rap for being 'two-faced,' they're actually very loyal friends who are often faced with indecision because they want to take all sides into consideration. If you're a Gemini, keep in mind that any decision is often better than no decision, and if you're a friend of a Gemini, remember that they're probably trying their best."

        'end_range' : [22, 10],
        'fact' : "A Libra never makes a decision willy-nilly. They always try to take as much into account as possible before making a choice, and their worst fear is being unfair or cruel to someone (even if they might deserve it.) If you're a Libra, try to remember that life isn't black-and-white, and it's OK to change your mind. If you're a friend of a Libra, try not to abuse their kindness and patience."

        'fact' : "Aquarians may be very reserved and shy, or very loud and in-charge. While that might seem contradictory, the underlying trait of honesty (even if it's brutal) is a driving force behind all Aquarians. You can always rely on an Aquarius to tell it like it is and give you a straight answer, no matter how uncomfortable it may be at first."

        'name': 'cancer',
        'start_range' : [21, 6],
        'end_range' : [22, 7],
        'fact' : "Cancers are very emotional creatures who are very in tune with those around them. Given the emphasis they place on interpersonal relationships, tiffs are never just tiffs. If you hurt a Cancer, be aware that they might not welcome you back into their lives with such open arms the second time around, if at all."

        'fact' : "Scorpios are known for the emotional intensity of their relationships. They never do something half-assed, and will know within seconds whether you'll get along or not. They'll never admit it because they have ~emotional walls~ and prefer to look aloof, but they're very loyal people."

        'fact' : "Uber-sensitive Pisces will often puts others' needs first â€” sometimes to such an extent they'll neglect their own. If you're a Pisces, watch out for this and make sure you're not letting people take advantage of you. And if you're a friend of Pisces, keep an eye out and make sure you're not abusing your Piscean friend's sensitivity and devotion."
